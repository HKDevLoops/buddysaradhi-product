    question: "Is the Free tier really free forever?",
    answer: "Yes. Free forever, up to 25 students, all features. No card. No trial. No \"upgrade to keep using.\" You will not be asked to pay until you cross 25 students — and even then, you can stay on Free with 25 students forever. We make money when you grow, not when you sign up.",

    question: "Does it work without internet?",
    answer: "Yes. Buddysaradhi is offline-first. Every write (add student, mark attendance, record fee, void entry, change setting) goes to your local database first. The sync engine pushes changes to Turso when you reconnect — every 30 seconds on web/desktop, every 30 seconds when foregrounded on mobile.",

    question: "Is my data safe? Do you sell it?",
    answer: "Your data is yours. We do not sell it, do not share it with third parties, do not run analytics on it. Backups are AES-256-GCM encrypted. The only network call is to your per-user database on Turso (Mumbai region).",

    question: "Can I export my data if I stop using Buddysaradhi?",
    answer: "Yes. Settings → Backup → Export. You get a .buddysaradhi file — a single encrypted envelope containing your entire database. The file is AES-256-GCM encrypted with a password you choose. You can restore from it on a new device.",

        question: "What is Buddysaradhi?",
        answer: "Buddysaradhi is the operating system for private tutors and small coaching institutes. Five screens — Dashboard, Students, Attendance, Fees, Settings. Seven engines under the hood. One append-only ledger. Zero servers to manage.",

        question: "How is this different from a school ERP?",
        answer: "School ERPs are built for principals — 200 features, 12 modules, 4-week onboarding. Buddysaradhi is built for tutors — 5 screens, 7 engines, 90-second onboarding. A school ERP does timetabling, transport, parent portals with 500 logins. Buddysaradhi does attendance, fees, receipts — and does them well.",

        question: "How long does it take to set up?",
        answer: "About 90 seconds. Sign up with your email + OTP. You land on an empty Dashboard. Add your first student. Mark today's attendance. Record your first fee. You are now using Buddysaradhi. No configuration, no batch setup — those happen inline when you need them.",
